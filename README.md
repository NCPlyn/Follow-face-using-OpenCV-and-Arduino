# Follow face using OpenCV, Arduino and Webcam
Python script (and Arduino sketch) to follow face using OpenCV, 28BYJ-48 stepper & servo and Webcam.

This script + arduino with stepper motor as yaw rotation and servo motor as pitch for the webcam, will basically follow any visible face.
There are two versions, one using haar cascades (faster but bad detection) and other one using Deep Neural Network & SSD (slower but precise).

## Prerequirements

## Windows
For windows install Python 3 and add it to your PATH. Next install pip3 and opencv-python, pyserial, imutils and numpy.

## Ubuntu
Run these commands to install dependencies

```bash
apt install python3 python3-pip

pip3 install opencv-python pyserial imutils numpy
```

For Arduino IDE, all libraires used are already in IDE. (Servo.h & Stepper.h)

## Usage

### Arduino & motors

Firstly connect your ULN2003 driver board to power and these pins on the Arduino:

```bash
IN1 ->> D8
IN2 ->> D9
IN3 ->> D10
IN4 ->> D11
```
And also connect your servo motor to power and its signal cable to pin 6 on the Arduino.

Ensure that if you move the servo to 0Â°, the webcam is looking few degrees down and not hiting anything.

Now you can upload the code in 'ardcode' folder to your Arduino.

### Python script

Open the one of the folders in command prompt or terminal.

Now you can start the python script using `followface.py` on Windows or `python3 followface.py` on Linux and enter the values of the serial port of the Arduino, webcam number and if you want to see detected faces etc.

**OR**

You can enter config file after it and skip all of that like this: `followface.py example.txt` or `python3 followface.py example.txt` on linux.

In the DNN version, you can press 'e', now the window frame will be updated every 30 frames, increasing the FPS by 2 frames (at least for me)

To exit, just press 'q'.

### BotControl.exe

This app works only on Windows and you need to have .NET framework installed (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework) (it can also work on linux using Wine, idunno)

Start the app, select port, click connect and now you can control the Arduino using your arrows.
